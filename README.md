# Guided Projects, books I've read, tutorials, etc.

Welcome! This is my collection of what I'm deeming as part of my mastery collection. Things such as guided projects, assignments from books, anything I've consumed to support my mission of becoming a Data Scientist and one day an AI Engineer.

Thank you!
